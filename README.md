Sheti Foundation is a farmer-centric non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and empowering the agricultural community in Maharashtra. Our mission is to reduce farmer distress, prevent suicides, and ensure resilience during crop failures by offering timely seed distribution, financial guidance, and emotional support.

We believe that every farmer deserves security, dignity, and a future. Through collaboration with donors, volunteers, and local communities, we strive to bridge the gap between policy and practice — delivering real help where and when it’s needed most.

From soil to success — we stand with our farmers.
